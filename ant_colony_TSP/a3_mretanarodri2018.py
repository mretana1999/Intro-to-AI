# Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
# The Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is inspired by the behavior of ants moving between destinations, dropping
# pheromones and acting on pheromones that they come across. The emergent behavior is ants converging to paths of
# least resistance.

# The Ant class encompasses the idea of an ant in the ACO algorithm.
# Ants will move to different cities and leave pheromones behind. Ants will also make a judgement about which
# city to visit next. And lastly, ants will have knowledge about their respective total distance travelled.
# - Memory: In the ACO algorithm, this is the list of cities already visited.
# - Best fitness: The shortest total distance travelled across all cities.
# - Action: Choose the next destination to visit and drop pheromones along the way.

# The ACO class encompasses the functions for the ACO algorithm consisting of many ants and cities to visit
# The general lifecycle of an ant colony optimization algorithm is as follows:

# - Initialize the pheromone trails: This involves creating the concept of pheromone trails between cities
# and initializing their intensity values.

# - Setup the population of ants: This involves creating a population of ants where each ant starts at a different
# city.

# - Choose the next visit for each ant: This involves choosing the next city to visit for each ant. This will
# happen until each ant has visited all cities exactly once.

# - Update the pheromone trails: This involves updating the intensity of pheromone trails based on the antsâ€™ movements
# on them as well as factoring in evaporation of pheromones.

# - Update the best solution: This involves updating the best solution given the total distance covered by each ant.

# - Determine stopping criteria: The process of ants visiting cities repeats for a number of iterations. One
# iteration is every ant visiting all cities exactly once. The stopping criteria determines the total number of
# iterations to run. More iterations will allow ants to make better decisions based on the pheromone trails.
